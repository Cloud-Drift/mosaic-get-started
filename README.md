# mosaic-get-started

This repository contains the notebook `get_started_with_mosaic_icedrift.ipynb` which showcases the Lagrangian dataset of [sea ice drift track from the Distributed Network of autonomous buoys deployed during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition 2019 - 2021.](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi:10.18739/A2KP7TS83). This dataset has been aggregated as a ragged array dataset as part of the Datasets module of the clouddrift python library.

This notebook should be readily executable in a binder environment which can be launched by clicking the "launch binder" badge above :point_up:. Alternatively, you can run the notebook in a python environment containing the python libraries listed in the file `environment.yml`.
